# Unity MCP Workflow

Use this skill when an AI agent is working in a Unity project and needs to verify code, prefabs, UI, Play Mode behavior, screenshots, scene hierarchy, console logs, domain reloads, or MCP connection issues.

## Operating Loop

1. Establish context.
   - Confirm the Unity project root and active scene.
   - Check that Unity MCP is reachable before assuming Editor state.
   - Inspect hierarchy, prefab paths, selected objects, and relevant component references through MCP.
   - If the user names an object, verify the real Unity object path before editing.
2. Choose the edit surface.
   - Edit source files with normal repo tools, then trigger Unity recompilation.
   - Edit scene objects through Unity APIs, mark the scene dirty, and save the scene.
   - Edit prefab assets with `PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents`, `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset`, and `PrefabUtility.UnloadPrefabContents`.
   - If the user is looking at an open scene instance, update the visible scene instance as well as the prefab asset when appropriate.
3. Execute changes.
   - Prefer one well-guarded `execute_code` batch over many fragile UI clicks.
   - Use null guards for every object lookup and return explicit missing-path messages.
   - Return concise before/after values from snippets.
   - Save only the assets or scenes intentionally modified.
   - **Do NOT modify GameObject hierarchy in scenes or prefabs through code or MCP tools.** Adding, removing, or restructuring GameObjects (children, parents, siblings) inside prefabs and scene hierarchies is fragile through automation. Instead, give the user clear step-by-step instructions to do it manually in the Unity Editor, and move on to code-side changes.
4. Validate.
   - Read back the changed objects through MCP.
   - For file edits, call `request_recompile`, then `wait_for_compilation`, then inspect console or compilation errors.
   - For runtime behavior, enter Play Mode or inspect live objects when needed.
   - Report exactly what was verified and what still requires device, store, network, or manual validation.

## Tool Exposure

- With the default `core` profile, rely on the focused workflow tools: `execute_code`, recompilation, Play Mode control, hierarchy, console logs, screenshots, input simulation, and performance inspection.
- With the default `full` profile, prefer specific MCP tools for simple scene, asset, GameObject, component, prefab, camera, UI, package, animation, file, or visual-feedback operations.
- If Tool Exposure is customized and a named tool is unavailable, adapt to the exposed tool list and report which expected tool is missing.

## MCP Call Pattern

If native MCP tools are not directly available, probe the local HTTP endpoint:

```bash
curl -sS -m 1 -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

For multi-line `execute_code` calls over curl, generate JSON with a real encoder instead of hand-escaping C#:

```bash
node - <<'NODE'
const code = String.raw`
using UnityEngine;

public class InspectSomething
{
    public static string Run()
    {
        var obj = GameObject.Find("PracticeInGameUiRoot");
        return obj != null ? obj.name : "not found";
    }
}
`;
const payload = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: 1,
  method: "tools/call",
  params: { name: "execute_code", arguments: { code } }
};
process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(payload));
NODE
```

## Unity C# Patterns

Use fully qualified types if the snippet environment or injected project code makes `using` statements unreliable:

```csharp
var root = UnityEngine.GameObject.Find("PracticeInGameUiRoot");
var rect = root.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
```

Use Unity null semantics for `UnityEngine.Object` references:

```csharp
if (image == null)
{
    return "Image missing";
}
```

For prefab edits:

```csharp
var path = "Assets/MyGame/UI/Prefabs/PF_PracticeInGameUiRoot.prefab";
var prefab = UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents(path);
try
{
    var target = prefab.transform.Find("SafeArea/SwingCancelZone");
    if (target == null)
    {
        return "SwingCancelZone not found in prefab";
    }

    var rect = target.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
    var before = rect.anchoredPosition;
    rect.anchoredPosition = new UnityEngine.Vector2(-76f, 448f);

    UnityEditor.EditorUtility.SetDirty(rect);
    UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset(prefab, path);
    UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();
    return "Prefab saved: pos " + before + " -> " + rect.anchoredPosition;
}
finally
{
    UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.UnloadPrefabContents(prefab);
}
```

For scene edits:

```csharp
var obj = UnityEngine.GameObject.Find("PracticeInGameUiRoot/SafeArea/SwingCancelZone");
if (obj == null)
{
    return "Scene object not found";
}

var rect = obj.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
var before = rect.sizeDelta;
UnityEditor.Undo.RecordObject(rect, "Update cancel zone");
rect.sizeDelta = new UnityEngine.Vector2(220f, 116f);
UnityEditor.EditorUtility.SetDirty(rect);
UnityEditor.SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty(obj.scene);
UnityEditor.SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.SaveScene(obj.scene);
return "Scene saved: size " + before + " -> " + rect.sizeDelta;
```

## Recompile And Reload

After external C# or asset file edits:

1. If Unity is in Play Mode, call `exit_play_mode` first — `request_recompile` is rejected during play because Unity does not run script compilation or domain reloads while playing.
2. Call `request_recompile`.
3. Call `wait_for_compilation`.
4. Read console or compilation errors before continuing.
5. If a domain reload drops the request, call `get_reload_recovery_status` when available, re-scan the MCP endpoint if needed, then continue from `wait_for_compilation`.

Do not treat a disconnected request as a successful compile.

After `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server is briefly unreachable while Unity reloads the domain. Before issuing the next tool call, poll a cheap endpoint such as `tools/list` (or `get_reload_recovery_status` if exposed) until you get a response — do not assume the connection survives the Play Mode transition.

## Verification Checklist

Use readback snippets that print exact values, not only `success`:

```csharp
var all = UnityEngine.Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<UnityEngine.Transform>();
UnityEngine.Transform target = null;
for (int i = 0; i < all.Length; i++)
{
    if (all[i].name == "SwingCancelZone")
    {
        target = all[i];
        break;
    }
}

if (target == null)
{
    return "SwingCancelZone not found";
}

var rect = target.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
return "path=" + target.name + "; pos=" + rect.anchoredPosition + "; size=" + rect.sizeDelta;
```

For UI work, verify prefab or scene hierarchy, sprite references, anchors, sorting order, active state, text fit, and button listeners. A populated `Content` hierarchy does not prove the user can see the UI.

For gameplay or network work, verify object identity, ownership, live instance existence, transform values, animation state, visibility, and whether client-side filters are discarding valid data.

## Failure Handling

- If MCP is unreachable, say so and fall back only to safe filesystem inspection or code edits. Do not claim scene, prefab, or runtime verification without Unity readback.
- If an object lookup fails, inspect hierarchy and prefab contents instead of inventing a path.
- If multiple matching objects exist, print their paths and choose the one matching the user-visible UI or current scene.
- If compile errors appear after a change, fix them before Play Mode validation.
- When Unity and text files disagree for serialized scene or prefab state, trust Unity readback and inspect the asset path.
